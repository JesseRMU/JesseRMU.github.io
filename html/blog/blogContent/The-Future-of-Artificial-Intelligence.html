      <h1>How AI is Changing Technology and Programming</h1>
      <br>
      <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a big topic these days, and it's changing the way we work in Information and
        Communication Technology (ICT). As a student in this field, it’s important to understand how AI is impacting
        technology and programming.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Making Work Easier</h3>
      <p>
        One of the biggest ways AI is changing ICT is by making tasks easier. Many jobs that used to take a lot of time
        can now be done quickly with AI tools. For example, in programming, AI can help with repetitive coding tasks, so
        developers can focus on more interesting problems. This not only saves time but also helps avoid mistakes.
      </p>
      <p>
        AI can analyze a lot of information much faster than people can. This helps companies make better decisions. In
        ICT, this means businesses can improve their operations and create better products for customers. Knowing how to
        use AI for data analysis will be a valuable skill when you start working in the field.
      </p>
      <h3>AI in Programming</h3>
      <p>AI is also changing how we learn and do programming. There are tools available that can help suggest code, find
        errors, and recommend good practices. This makes it easier for both new and experienced programmers to write
        code more quickly and correctly. As a student, learning how to use these AI tools can give you an advantage in
        your future job.</p>
      <h3>What’s Next?</h3>
      <p>In the future, AI will likely become an even bigger part of ICT. As AI technologies improve, we can expect new
        solutions that make our work easier and more effective. For students and professionals, staying updated on AI
        trends will be important for success in the field.</p>
      <p>AI is changing the way we work in technology and programming. While it brings many opportunities, it also
        presents challenges that we need to understand. By learning about AI and how it affects ICT, we can be better
        prepared for a future where technology plays a bigger role in our lives.</p>
