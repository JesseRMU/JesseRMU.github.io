      <h1>Choosing the right study</h1>
      <br>
      <p>
        Choosing the right study program was both exciting and a bit nerve-wracking. From a young age, I was passionate
        about making music, which naturally led me to spend a lot of time with computers. This early interest in
        technology grew as I learned how to use various software and digital tools for my music production.
      </p>
      <p>
        When it came time to choose a study program, I wasn’t sure exactly what I wanted to do. I decided to visit open
        days for different programs to explore my options. Through these visits, I discovered the HBO-ICT program. At
        first, I was uncertain if ICT was the right fit for me, but I couldn’t think of a better option that combined my
        interests in technology and creativity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, even though I don’t have a clear idea of exactly what I want to do in the future, I’m confident it will
        involve computers or digital fields. My interest in cryptocurrency and digital technologies also plays a part in
        this decision. Overall, the HBO-ICT program feels like the right choice for me, offering the perfect mix of
        creativity and technical skills.
