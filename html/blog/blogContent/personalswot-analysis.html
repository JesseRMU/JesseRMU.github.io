    <section>
      <p>To help me figure out my path in ICT, I did a SWOT analysis. This means looking at my strengths,
        weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Here’s what I found:</p>

      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <p>
        One of my biggest strengths is that I’m very precise. When I do something, I make sure to do it well. I also
        think I’m quite creative and good at solving problems. In music production, being able to think outside the box
        is super helpful, and I believe my creativity helps me a lot.
      </p>
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <p>
        On the other side, I know I have some weaknesses. I often have trouble starting tasks on time and planning them
        out. I tend to begin things late, and I don’t always work as fast as I’d like. I know that improving my planning
        skills is important, especially in ICT.
      </p>
      <h3>Opportunities</h3>
      <p>
        Looking ahead, I see many opportunities for myself. I’m not exactly sure what I want to do in the future, but I
        know it will involve computers. The HBO-ICT program I’m studying is giving me the skills I need for such a
        career. Topics like programming and networking are preparing me for whatever comes next.
      </p>
      <h3>Threats</h3>
      <p>
        There are also some threats I need to think about. Sometimes, my motivation isn’t very high, and I struggle a
        lot with
        planning. This can make it hard for me to finish my study. Plus, the fast pace of technology and competition in
        ICT can be challenging. Another significant threat is the rise of artificial intelligence. As AI
        technology advances, there’s a risk that many traditional ICT jobs could become unnecessary, making it crucial
        for me to adapt and continuously update my skills.
